# Time Puzzle

## Puzzle Premise

This project will be a top down puzzle game involving projectiles and other objects such as pressure plates.
There will be a player that can only move in four directions, up, down, left, and right.
This player can move one tile per button press.
The main premise of the puzzle is there will be an arrow/indicator pointing in either of the four directions the player can move.
If the player moves in the direction of the arrow then time will move one step forward (aka. the projectiles will move forward one tile or two depending on their given velocity).
If the player decides to move opposite to the arrow then time will move backwards, and if the player moves orthogonally to the arrow time won't move at all (the projectiles will stay still).
The arrow indicating the direction of time may or may not be static in further levels (it may switch directions mid game).
There will also be a timer and/or a move counter to see how fast and efficiently the player can complete the level.
This software is designed for people who like to play games/puzzles in their free time.
I've always been interested in both the concept of time and the creation of games in general.
To me this is a good opportunity to both create a puzzle I find interesting and to get more practice in with Java.
